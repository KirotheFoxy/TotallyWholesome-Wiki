# Toy Integrations

## Toy Control
if you want to get your toys controlled make sure to enable it in the settings and restart afterward (not always required but a good habit to do so)

## Control
Each pet can be controlled individually via the ActionMenu or via the QuickMenu. You won't get any feedback if the pet has a toy connected and allowed control. ~Well you will probably see a reaction on the pet if it works~

## VibeGoBrrr Integration
If you are already using VibeGoBrrr you can ignore everything afterward. If VGB is detected it is integrated into the VGB environment as a sensor. This means the strongest value between your Touchzones, DPS, and TW.

## Setup Intiface (Buttplug.io)
Luckily for you, you don't need to set up Intiface. If you still want feel free to [download](https://intiface.com/desktop/) and install it.
If you want to use your own installation make sure to start the Intiface server first before you start VRC.
